## DataSet
- Data used in this project consists of 10 columns

## Workflow Followed
1. Data Importing
2. Data shaping/processing
3. Split the data into Train and Test Sets.
4. Selecting the model
5. Fit the train data in the model.
6. Predict on the test data.
7. Get the metrics like accuracy of the model.

## Modules Used
1. `pandas` - data processing
2. `sklearn` - transforming data & Importing the model
